# Profile
Full stack software Engineer.

> Measure Twice Cut Once

My previous career in the fast paced industry of property management taught me the importance of planning ahead & adapting to new problems. Prior to this, I studied illustration at university & was a gallery represented Artist. For me, programming combines my two passions; problem solving & creativity.

The best quality about tech is it's sense of community and ability to make the impossible, possible. A priority I'm looking for in a company is one that is passionate and can define the value it adds to the world. I am motivated by oppertunities to learn & become a better developer than I was yesterday.

# Skills
#### 🔸 Problem solver
Communication & teamwork are key.
As a property manager I used knowledge of each unique property to anticipate issues contractors might encounter onsite. Ensuring instructions are clear & sufficient site access has been arranged between multiple parties. Weighing up the cost effectiveness of a solution.  

#### 🔸 Fast learner
I started work in the property sector inexperienced. By demonstrating a willingness to learn, I was promoted to managing my own portfolio after 16 months. I apply the same mindset to programming; learning to build an app in a new language in under two weeks.

#### 🔸 Creative   
Strong creative and visual communication skills.
