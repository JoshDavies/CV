# Profile
Full stack software developer.

> Measure Twice, Cut Once.

For me, programming combines my two passions; problem solving & creativity. My previous career in the fast paced industry of property management taught me the importance of planning ahead & adapting to new problems. Prior to this, I studied illustration at university & was a gallery represented Artist. 

The best quality about tech is it's community and that it there is always something new to learn. I am eager to join a passionate company that provides oppertunities to become a better developer.

### 🎳 Bowling Challenge
**JavaScript (ES5), Jasmine, JQuery, chart.js**  
A web app that calculates a players bowling score. I enjoyed coding the surprisingly complex rules of Bowling, finding patterns within the conditions & refactoring them. The app uses jQuery & chart.js to return more data than is originally entered.

# Skills
#### 🔸 Problem solver
I enjoy breaking complexity down into simple steps by planning ahead & evalutating solutions. Following this process as a developer ensures that I understand the task set and pay close attention to the details. As a property manager, good communication with residents & contractors was fundamental to resolving all manner of problems. 
  
#### 🔸 Fast learner
I completed Makers Academy's intensive devleoper course, learning to build an app in a new language within two weeks for my final project. In my last career, I was promoted from entry level to managing my own portfolio after 16 months by demonstrating a willingness to learn.
  
#### 🔸 Creative   
I am passionate about great design of all kinds, including devoloping well structured code. I enjoy thinking of new approaches to reach a goal. Studying as an artist, taught me to continually self-evaluate work and seek peer feedback in order to improve.
