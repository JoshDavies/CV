# Profile
Full stack software Engineer.

> Measure Twice, Cut Once.

My previous career in the fast paced industry of property management taught me the importance of planning ahead & adapting to new problems. Prior to this, I studied illustration at university & was a gallery represented Artist. For me, programming combines my two passions; problem solving & creativity.

For me, the best quality about tech is it's sense of community and that it is constantly growing. I am eager to join a passionate company that provides oppertunities for myself to become a better developer.

# Skills
#### 🔸 Problem solver
Communication & teamwork are key to solving a problem. As a property manager I worked closely with residents and contractors to co-ordinate and resolve all kinds of issues. As a coder, I enjoy breaking complexity down into simple steps and dividing responsibilites between team members.  

#### 🔸 Creative   
I am Passionate about good design of all kinds, including devoloping well structured code. Studying as an artist, taught me to continually self-evaluate work and listen to peer feedback in order to improve.    

#### 🔸 Fast learner
I started work in the property sector inexperienced. By demonstrating a willingness to learn, I was promoted to managing my own portfolio after 16 months. I apply the same mindset to programming; learning to build an app in a new language in under two weeks.
